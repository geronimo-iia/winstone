Using Xerces as an XML parser (required for v2.4 webapps)

As part of the upgrade in the servlet specification, the v2.4 incarnation of the web.xml file is validated using XML Schema Documents (XSD) as opposed to Document Type Definitions (DTD). While I still have no idea why such a change was necessary - especially given that DTD validation seems to be more than enough in this case - I did implement it. Perhaps the people on the specification committee might want to give a thought to container size next time round, as this one change multiplies the size of the distribution by five.

Anyway, to use Xerces, you'll need to download the latest Xerces-J parser from here, and copy xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar into a folder somewhere (name it "endorsed"). Putting them in the winstone/lib folder will not work, because they must be in the system endorsed classpath to override the JDK internal XML parser.

Then add -Djava.endorsed.dirs=<endorsed dir name> as a JVM arg to your command line for starting winstone, eg:

  java -Djava.endorsed.dirs=/jdk/endorsed -jar winstone.jar --webroot=.
